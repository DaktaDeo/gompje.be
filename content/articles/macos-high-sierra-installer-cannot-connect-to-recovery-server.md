Check the system date. When its not close to the present, the server will not connect<sup>*</sup>.

How?

  1. Open Terminal:Â  &#8220;utilities&#8221; > terminal
  2. type &#8220;date&#8221; in the bash display, it wil display the current set system date. Mine was 1/1/x (don&#8217;t remember the set year) &#8211; because the battery was serviced and got disconnected.
  3. set the date with &#8220;date 0426172718&#8221; to set the date to april (04) 26, and the time to 17 hours, 27 minutes and the year 18 for 2018
  4. close terminal
  5. run install

(*) However it&#8217;s also very likely that you forgot that the wifi is not set yet&#8230; luckily you get a very good descriptive error message /s
