🤔 Hmm...Good question! I'm a thinker, thinkerer and builder of things. What?

You want my name?

Oh! Yes. 😊

Let's start that again, shall we?

Hi there, 👋 <br/>I’m Veerle Deschepper, a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, writer, 
photographer, reader, painter, and I love to create Art – every tiny bit of it. I’m also a lego, geocaching, 
cats and X-files fan.

And yes... I do have my very own homelab in Gentbrugge -thats in Belgium- with <nuxt-link to="/uses">lots, lots, and lots of gear</nuxt-link>. 😏

Oh. Yeah. I do speak Dutch as well. In fact it’s my mother tongue.. technically..

I ❤ my cat, my friends, my family, boardgames, doodling, writing, Lego, code, 3D printing, drawing, photography, improving my life, reading, being outdoors and finding hidden treasures.

Sometimes <nuxt-link to="/articles">I write useful posts</nuxt-link>, <nuxt-link to="/journal">sometimes very silly</nuxt-link>, and <nuxt-link to="/nantucket">a bit dark ones</nuxt-link>.  **But most times I write, create, build, code, play and explore other realities.**  

<small>.. I&#8217;m also a Scout for life &#8211; Creative Sifaka &#8211; present!</small>

**INFP &#8211; W**ork.**I**n.**P**rogress ✌️
