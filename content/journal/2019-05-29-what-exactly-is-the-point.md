Welp. I just got an e-mail with as message &#8220;you have a confidential message from x from Az Jan-Palfijn&#8221;. With a link. That link takes me to this page:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-633" src="https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?resize=1486%2C648&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1486" height="648" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?w=1486&ssl=1 1486w, https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?resize=300%2C131&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?resize=768%2C335&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?resize=1024%2C447&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-29-at-14.58.19.png?resize=150%2C65&ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

And says &#8220;well before you can read this super secret message, you have to unlock it.. by sending an e-mail to the .. exact same e-mail address as before&#8221;.

Doing that, takes you back to your mail, which contains just a temp link to this page again. Then I can read the message. (and download it)

It wasn&#8217;t confidential in any way: no test results or anything like that. But even if it was, what is the point of this roundtrip to the same medium? Its like a very poor implementation at an attempt of 2FA. If they wanted to build in a security layer &#8211; I get it why they would &#8211; they should just have send me a code with sms on my phone.

You know like 2FA..

They have my phone. They send messages to remind you about appointments. This.. I do not get at all.
