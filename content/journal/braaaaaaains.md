I have a neurological, incurable  disease. Not fatal. Not curable. Maybe not degradable. Should be manageable.  Anyway things are looking up now, the manageable thing. For now. We&#8217;re hopeful.

Slowly working through a huge backlog and looking trough files I stumble upon this screenshot:

<content-image wide src='/img/screenshot-using-console-to-calculate-datediff.png' alt="screenshot of using console to calculate dates"></content-image>

I had to calculate the date for 1 month before my operation and 2 months later. Couldn&#8217;t do this easy thing by hard, I mean how difficult is it really to add 2 months to a date in October? or subtract a month? Riiiiiight. not hard.

But on 31/10/2017 it was. In fact it was so hard that my brain decided to go to the momentjs website, fire up console, create a new js date and do some calculations with it. I just.. its funny and sad at the same time.

This is what suffering a neurological disease looks like. You&#8217;re not thinking straight and do silly things. Its like being drunk, high, and sleep deprived all the time.

It&#8217;s exhausting.

It&#8217;s isolating & extremely frustrating.
