Those 66 open useful tabs aren&#8217;t rare &#8211; at least not for me. But on a single 13-inch retina screen, on a 4y+ old computer with lots of other stuff going on.. it was like a mini stress-test. Although I hardly noticed. Some things just took a while to load up.

Maybe I should reboot ðŸ¤”

```console
$ uptime
> 23:16  up 31 days, 11:59, 7 users, load averages: 1.93 2.27 2.32
```

but&#8230;..naaaaaaaaaah!
