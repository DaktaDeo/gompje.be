Got a mail today. (=yesterday) From Ikea. This was the main heading. It says &#8220;The New Veerle Deserves a Personalized Approach&#8221;. In Dutch. With my name &#8216;_Ikea-a-ne-lized_&#8216;Â you know with the dots on the E&#8217;s and all. Thats funny and clever.

But.. its just.. one of those serendipity moments? Yes I think you could call it just that. Given that I am actually a totally new person in every way today. This could not be more true. &#8212; its like they know. they feel it. It&#8217;s the end people! AI is here to take over! run!

Nah!  
Its just coincidence. Fun though.
