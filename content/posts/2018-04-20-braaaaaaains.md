I have a neurological, incurable  disease. Not fatal. Not curable. Maybe not degradable. Should be manageable.  Anyway things are looking up now, the manageable thing. For now. We&#8217;re hopeful.

Slowly working through a huge backlog and looking trough files I stumble upon this screenshot:

<img class="alignright wp-image-233 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_4240-e1524257520924-658x1024.jpg?resize=229%2C412&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="229" height="412" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_4240-e1524257520924.jpg?zoom=2&resize=229%2C412&ssl=1 458w, https://i1.wp.com/gompje.be/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_4240-e1524257520924.jpg?zoom=3&resize=229%2C412&ssl=1 687w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> I had to calculate the date for 1 month before my operation and 2 months later. Couldn&#8217;t do this easy thing by hard, I mean how difficult is it really to add 2 months to a date in October? or subtract a month? Riiiiiight. not hard.

But on 31/10/2017 it was. In fact it was so hard that my brain decided to go to the momentjs website, fire up console, create a new js date and do some calculations with it. I just.. its funny and sad at the same time.

This is what suffering a neurological disease looks like. You&#8217;re not thinking straight and do silly things. Its like being drunk, high, and sleep deprived all the time.

It&#8217;s exhausting.

It&#8217;s isolating & extremely frustrating.
