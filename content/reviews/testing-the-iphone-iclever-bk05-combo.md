[go straight to the short review][1]

What to do when you have a few minutes to spare before an appointment? Actually there are a lot of things I normally do but today I find myself sitting, alone, in the sun, in a very very busy cafeteria. I just had to share this sudden found bliss &#8211; and what better way to do that while testing my fairly new BK05 keyboard. Well a better way would be to enjoy the delicious food they serve here but.. its not time to eat yet.

Anyway.

I have lots of keyboards at home. Lots of wired ones, some wireless, the default Apple Bluetooth ones, a mechanical one, a .. well you get the picture: I have a _lot_ of keyboards. I type a lot. An with my illness typing can be a challenge. When I bought the first iPad, I bought an Apple BT keyboard to go with it. But that was clumsy. I took this combo with me the first time I went to London. Tried to use it on the train, but it failed miserably. Didn&#8217;t pair, then it did but it suddenly lost connection. It proved to be a cumbersome thing to pack. Why more trouble than its worth. In to the drawer it went. I took my MacBook next time.

When the iPad Pro came round, I jumped on it: the pencil is just marvellous! Finally the quest for a digital paper-a-like was over! I bought the Smart Keyboard as well. God that was a mistake. It&#8217;s not only ugly, but it doesn&#8217;t work that well. It&#8217;s not nice to type on at all. It doesn&#8217;t have backlight. And to make it worse, the lettering isn&#8217;t white. I can type blind but still need help with special chars and my fingers just wandered to much. I took my MacBook with me, it could do more in the end and just typed better. I gave up on finding a mobile typing solution.

But I dunno &#8211; I guess it kept nagging; some kind of missed feeling: I wanted to be able to write on the go. Preferably without the added weight & bulk of the MacBook. I wanted a solution that could go with me everywhere &#8211; that worked with my iPhone. On a wimp I bought the iClever BK05 keyboard. The reviews where a bit mixed. But well something just felt right.

## TL:DR;

### Positive
  * Broadcom Bluetooth chip. These chips are the holy grail of BT
  * Backlight
  * QWERTY US
  * Foldable and lightweight but still a full keyboard

### Negative
  * A small e-ink display would be nice to see battery level, connection strength etc
  * Blindly pushing FN+{key} for the special settings and connections

&nbsp;

## Experience

### Connecting

This is actually the second time of me using it. First time with the WordPress app. I paired it once and it just connects/ disconnects automatically like it should when unfolding/folding. There are some issues with the language setting, but that&#8217;s software. I use a Dutch virtual keyboard and an English one &#8211; that way I can get the right autocorrect. This always causes when switching to a hardware keyboard b/c you cannot see the language setting anymore. For some reason this keyboard didn&#8217;t trigger the language popup when using the fn+globe shortcut. Not sure why.

### Typing

Very very comfortable. Not as good as my code mechanical keyboard &#8211; but it closely resembles the MacbookPro retina one. Has the same size, full keys and the correct finger guidance helping things.

### Lightning

In full daylight and very sunny conditions the background light isn&#8217;t visible.

tbc.
