## Multipotentialite
A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.

Multipotentialites have no ‚Äúone true calling‚Äù the way specialists do. Being a multipotentialite is our destiny. We have many paths and we pursue all of them, either sequentially or simultaneously (or both).

Multipotentialites thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills. We are excellent at bringing disparate ideas together in creative ways. This makes us incredible innovators and problem solvers.

When it comes to new interests that emerge, our insatiable curiosity leads us to absorb everything we can get our hands on. As a result, we pick up new skills fast and tend to be a wealth of information.

## LARAVEL + VUEJS
I mean‚Ä¶ who needs to say more! these two are a killer combination to make awesome stuff that works, is scalable _and_ maintainable.

## OPENSOURCE
Opensource is the way the world should work: all people working together to make it a better place. Contribute when they can, combine knowledge. You learn so much from what others have done!

I‚Äôm all for a healthy mix: opensource when needed, closed when its necessary.
