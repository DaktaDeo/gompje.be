### Community 
Opensource is the way the world should work: all people working together to make it a better place.
Contribute when they can, combine knowledge. You learn so much from what others have done! 
I‚Äôm all for a healthy mix: opensource when needed, closed when its necessary.

#### LARAVEL + VUEJS
I mean‚Ä¶ who needs to say more! these two are a killer combination to make awesome stuff that works, is scalable _and_ maintainable.

### I'm good at...
I‚Äôm good at problem solving, Object Oriented thinking, simple solutions for complex questions, able to connect many far-flung dots into a single theme, building IT web apps for people, consulting for a wide area of IT solutions, writing, and hands on training.

#### Some history
I like to work with PHP with the Laravel Framework. I used to work with AngularJS and before that jQuery and even longer ago: plain js with some IE flavouring. ‚Äî but today I really prefer VueJS. 

I manage most of my servers (droplets), they run Ubuntu LTS now. They used to run on Debian. I‚Äôm no Linux expert, neither a windows one 
(anymore) and a growing MacOS one ‚Äì but I prefer to write code, not ICT.
For others I use K8s and custom Docker images.

I said goodbye to Apache a long time ago, now Nginx is my friend. Just like I now use Yarn instead of NPM or Bower to manage my deps. 
Combined with Webpack instead of the now ancient Gulp .. and the one with the wild pork logo. I use css, with Sass or Less. or not.

As communication-tool I prefer to use Slack, its so much more convenient than e-mail. That last one I do manage myself, with G-suite.

I worked with .NET ages ago, for nearly 10 years in fact. While I don‚Äôt use it anymore, I‚Äôm still familiar with it.
Guess I took the best bits of those best practices and let them shape my Javascript and PHP code into beautiful, scalable, manageable pieces of art. üòÅ

### I'm Human 
As a person I tend to be idealistic, resilient attitude in the face of hardship, seeker of value and harmony, open minded, IT in function of the user advocate, flexible, very creative, passionate, energetic, dedicated, and hard working.

#### I'm a Multipotentialite
A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.

Multipotentialites have no ‚Äúone true calling‚Äù the way specialists do. Being a multipotentialite is our destiny. We have many paths and we pursue all of them, either sequentially or simultaneously (or both).

Multipotentialites thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills. We are excellent at bringing disparate ideas together in creative ways. This makes us incredible innovators and problem solvers.

When it comes to new interests that emerge, our insatiable curiosity leads us to absorb everything we can get our hands on. As a result, we pick up new skills fast and tend to be a wealth of information.

#### I'm a HSP
This means I'm sensitive to external stimul. Light, sound, emotions -- they all get apliflied.
I usually knows when someone is stressed out before even they know it.

Downside is that I absolutely need to work in an environment I have complete control over, with as low as sensory as possible. 

Upside? It makes me great at solving and erasing underlying frustrations in others. Which makes for some great tools & solutions! üòé

#### I'm very creative and non-time person
To be at my best, I need to have the most flexible agenda possible. While I have no issue with meetings or deadlines -- I cannot work in a fixed shedule.
Nothing I do has a fixed shedule. Sometimes I do my best work at 20h, somethimes at 10am. 

I think all the time, build when the üéâ hits me -- and that cannot be at a set fixed timeslot.
